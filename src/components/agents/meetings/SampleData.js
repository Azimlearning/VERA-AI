MEETING NOTES:

John: Good morning everyone. Let's start by reviewing our Q3 performance. Sarah, can you share the numbers?

Sarah: Sure. We exceeded our targets by 15% in Q3. Story submissions were up 20%, and engagement metrics improved significantly. However, we noticed some areas that need attention.

Mike: What areas are you referring to?

Sarah: Meeting follow-ups are lagging. We have several action items from previous meetings that haven't been completed. Also, our content pipeline needs more consistency.

John: Understood. For Q4, our primary objective is to maintain this momentum while addressing these gaps. I want Sarah to prepare a detailed action plan by next week.

Sarah: I'll have that ready by Friday. I'll need input from Mike on the technical requirements.

Mike: I can provide that by Wednesday. We should also discuss the new podcast initiative that was mentioned last month.

Lisa: I've been working on that. We need to finalize the topics and schedule. I suggest we start with PETRONAS 2.0 overview as our first episode.

John: Good idea. Let's set a deadline for the first podcast script by the end of this month.

Mike: I'll coordinate with the content team on this.

Sarah: One more thing - we need to review vendor contracts. Some are expiring soon.

John: That's important. Can someone take ownership of that?

[No clear owner assigned]

Mike: Also, we should implement the new expense approval process we discussed.

[No due date mentioned]

Sarah: I'll prepare training materials for the team on the new processes.

[No owner assigned]

John: Let's also prepare a regulatory compliance checklist for the upcoming audit.

[No due date specified]

Lisa: I'll contact local partners to coordinate the outreach program.

[No owner and no due date]

John: Great. Let's wrap up. Key decisions today:
1. Maintain Q3 momentum for Q4

3. Launch podcast initiative with PETRONAS 2.0 topic
